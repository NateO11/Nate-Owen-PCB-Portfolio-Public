# Automatic Drink Dispenser

This project involved the design and development of an automatic drink dispensing system capable of preparing beverages through user interaction with an integrated touchscreen interface. The system demonstrates coordinated control of sensing, fluid actuation and real time user input to automate drink preparation without manual intervention.

The system centers around a microcontroller driven control design that manages user selection, liquid dispensing and inventory monitoring across multiple hardware subsystems. A touchscreen display allows users to select predefined drinks, after which peristaltic pumps dispense precise volumes of liquids required for each recipe while onboard sensors continuously monitor system status.

Key System Features

- Touchscreen graphical user interface for drink selection and system feedback

- Automated liquid dispensing using electronically controlled pumps

- Ultrasonic distance sensors used to measure container fill levels and detect low liquid conditions

- SPI communication used for high speed display 

- I2C communication supporting distributed sensor integration

The project was developed to explore full-stack embedded system integration, combining PCB design, communication protocols, fluid control and interactive control into a single autonomous platform. Emphasis was placed on reliable hardware communication, modular subsystem design and scalable architecture suitable for future expansion into fully autonomous robotic bartending applications.
