# Nate-Owen-PCB-Portfolio-Private
This is my private portfolio for PCB and embedded systems designs.

## About Me:
I’m an Electrical Engineering student at the University of Virginia focused on PCB design, embedded systems and robotics. My interests and work centers on designing hardware systems with well integrated microcontrollers, motor control, sensors and real time communication protocols. I am passionate about building electromechanical systems that bridge hardware and software.

## Projects

### Embedded Bluetooth Assistive Toy PCB

Developed a compact embedded PCB for an interactive assistive learning toy featuring Bluetooth communication, motor contorl, LED feedback, force sensor and IR sensor integration. Implemented reliable peripheral coordination using SPI and I²C communication for responsive interaction.

### Temperature Sensing Fan

Designed of a custom PCB based cooling system that dynamically controls DC fan speed using temperature feedback from an onboard sensor. An STM32 microcontroller reads temperature data and adjusts motor speed through PWM control of an H-bridge motor driver, allowing the fan to automatically respond to changing thermal conditions or be manually controlled through a potentiometer.

### Autonomous Drink Maker PCB

Engineered a fully integrated control PCB for an autonomous drink making machine managing pumps, motors, distance sensors. Designed power distribution and embedded firmware to coordinate automated beverage preparation from ingredient dispensing to drink level detection.
